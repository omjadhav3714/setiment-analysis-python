## Description

* Because technology is constantly being updated, Social Media serves as a platform for these updates to reach a large audience.
* But as the technology makes solutions it also keeps on creating a new problem so if a comment is being released on a post we cant judge the sentiments of the comments by just reading it sometimes!
* So we have created a solution in the form web app where user just have to copy and paste the comment and the app would give an analysis of the comment.
